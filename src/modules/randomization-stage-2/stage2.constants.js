 * Stage 2 — approved constants and their sources.
 *
 * Source legend:
 *  [O] Official — APSEC Circular No.12/USEC/2026 dated 27.03.2026 (per
 *      Stage 1 module verification against polling.pdf) + Employees
 *      data proforma template (blank template headers).
 *  [P] Proposed — Stage 2 implementation proposal, NOT an official rule.
 *      Team must ratify.
 *  [U] Unresolved — official source silent or not re-verified here; the
 *      module fails closed instead of guessing.
 *
 * Team-size rule [O] (Stage 1 constants, circular p.2, re-stated here for
 * Stage 2 enforcement — Stage 1 marks it informational only):
 *  per polling station 1 Presiding Officer + 5 Polling Officers;
 *  shortage (District Election Authority authorised): 1 + 4 with 3rd/4th
 *  duties merged.
 *
 * Party-formation rules [O] (circular OCR-verified 2026-10-13, pp.60-61):
 *  - Presiding Officer must be of higher scale/grade than every Polling
 *    Officer (p.60(g): "The Presiding Officer should be of higher scale /
 *    grade in comparison to all Polling Officers"; p.61(a) repeats it;
 *    seniority takes relative cadre position into account, not pay alone).
 *    The exact designation/pay mapping is [U], so the module enforces this
 *    through explicit per-employee `seniorityRank` (lower = higher
 *    scale/grade) + `presidingEligible` from an agreed mapping — never
 *    inferred from salary or designation strings.
 *  - members of a party must come from different offices/departments
 *    (p.61 "proper mixing ... at the time of formation of a polling party";
 *    p.61(c): "Two members of the polling party should not be from the
 *    same office or school");
 *  - no person posted to their work Mandal or native Mandal (p.59: posted
 *    outside place of duty and native Mandals; p.61(b)).
